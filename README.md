# Learning React

## Section - I

### What is React/ReactJS?

- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React is not a framework â€“ it's not even exclusive to the web.
- It's used with other libraries to render to certain environments.
- It is a client-side JavaScript library.
- React is all about modern, reactive user interfaces for the web.

### Why React instead of "Just JavaScript"?

- Most of the modern programming languages fall into two general paradigms: imperative (procedural, OOP etc.) and declarative(functional etc.).
- Imperative code focuses on writing an explicit sequence of commands to describe how you want the computer to do things, and declarative code focuses on specifying the result of what you want.
- JavaScript uses imperative approach and React uses a declarative approach which makes easy to build modern, rich, complex user interfaces easier.

<!-- - In JavaScript we have to write code for every single step that should be taken; to create an element, to set its content, to add classes, to add click listner then what should happen on that click listner every single step needs to be described; this way of programming and bringing something on the screen is called an imperative approach.

- In case of ReactJS our code looks different we can add custome HTML component. React is all about these components.
- React is splitting our application into small building blocks, small components, where evry building block, every component, has a clear task their for our code stays maintainable and manageable and React, the library, will do the heavy lifting to rendring something on to the screen.
- React makes building modern, rich, complex user interfaces easier.
- It uses declarative approach. -->

### What is Single Page Application(SPA)?

- React can be used to control parts of HTML pages or entire pages; i.e 'Widget' approach on a multi-page-application, these pages are still rendered on and served by a backend server.
- React can also be used to control the entire frontend of a web application; i.e. Single-Page-Application. server only sends one HTML page, thereafter, React takes over and controls the UI
